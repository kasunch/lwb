These files document the source code of Glossy, a flooding architecture for wireless sensor networks, implemented in \href{http://www.sics.se/contiki/}{\tt Contiki} based on Tmote Sky sensor nodes.

Glossy was published at ACM/IEEE IPSN '11 in the paper titled \href{ftp://ftp.tik.ee.ethz.ch/pub/people/ferrarif/FZTS2011.pdf}{\tt Efficient network flooding and time synchronization with Glossy}, which also received the best paper award.

This documentation is divided into three main parts: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{group__glossy-test}{Simple application for testing Glossy}: Example of a simple application that periodically floods a packet and prints related statistics. \item \hyperlink{group__glossy__interface}{Glossy API}: API provided by Glossy for an application that wants to use it. \item \hyperlink{group__glossy__internal}{Glossy internal functions}: Functions used internally by Glossy during a flood.\end{DoxyItemize}
A complete overview of the documentation structure is available \href{modules.html}{\tt here}.
